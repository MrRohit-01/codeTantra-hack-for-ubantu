Question Code: 9.1.9

Evaluation of postfix expression is a problem that is related to ยง
For example consider a postfix Expression: 8 43* +5/2-
+ First operation to be computed is 4*3 = 12.
+ Then 12 sums with 8 and gives us intermediate result 20.
+ Then 20 will be divided by 5 and give us intermediate result 4
+ At the end after subtracting 2 with 4 we get the final result 2.
Working of the algorithm step by step to evaluate postfix expre:
Note: The postfix expression to be evaluated is treated as a string, '
Step 1:
Traverse the string from 0 index to last index (length - 1 = 8). At ind
stack. Similarly, at index 1 and 2, we get 4 and 3 respectively which
Whenever we found any operand we push it on the stack, this is our
Status of stack is:
13]
141
18]
Operand 3 is on the top.
Step 2:
Continue traversal in the string and at index 3, we will get an operat
operands from the stack (3 and 4) and compute the operation ' * * be
4*3=12 and push the computed result back to stack.
After this status of stack is:
[12]
18]
Now operand 12 is on the top.
